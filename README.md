# ledSync
Sync led with music, using Arduino and Python.

After some update, now the code is fine, there are some issues yet. However is possible to control more than one led in all the three mode: single color led, RGB led and in real time with RGB leds. I will upload a C++ code which work with Arduino, but using a frequency to volt converter. Actually these scripts in Python use just a microphone attched to a computer connected to an Arduino board with some leds.
